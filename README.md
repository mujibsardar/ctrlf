###Project Procedure
- Product Decision: Our team reached a consesus based on anaylizing what users primarily use search engines for. We wanted to develop a search engine where one can both search and add data to the result.
- Work distribution: After scoping out the project, work was distriubted based on the final merge point, which was the search result render with our application data appended. 
- Communication: Combination of individual work and paired-programming required our team to communicate frequently and think in parallel to each other.
- Polish & Publish: With the MVP accomplishment, we added additional features and polished the interface for better user experience.

###MVP

Users are able to query/search for the results and also able to view/add comments on the page. Both the original result and added comments viewable in the same page.
